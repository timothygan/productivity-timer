**Date**: 2025-09-01 16:30:00
**Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress - RPER Cycle Started
**Duration**: Starting now
**Next Memory ID**: memory-004

## Original User Prompt
> Excellent! Now, we need to fix the settings functionality. The button doesn't work, and I'm unable to change the time boundaries for the focus/break time. Furthermore, the buttons are quite ugly, make them more aesthetic. [Image #1] here are some images of more aesthetic timers you can draw inspiration from.

## Context Loaded
- memory-002_fix-initialization-errors.md - Previous successful fixes, protocol violations learned
- Current app status: Fully functional timer at http://localhost:3000/
- Settings modal exists but not opening (identified in memory-002)
- User provided aesthetic inspiration images showing beautiful timer designs

## Todo List Evolution
### Current Plan - RPER Protocol
- [x] Create memory-003 for settings functionality and aesthetic improvements
- [ ] Phase 1: Launch prompt-clarifier agent to structure requirements
- [ ] Phase 2: Launch research agents to analyze current settings implementation  
- [ ] Phase 3: Launch planning agents for settings fix and aesthetic redesign
- [ ] Phase 4: Launch implementation agents to fix settings and enhance aesthetics
- [ ] Phase 5: Launch review agents to validate functionality and aesthetics

## Issues from Previous Memory
- Settings modal present but not opening (low priority issue from functionality-reviewer)
- Basic UI styling needs aesthetic enhancement
- Button designs need improvement per user feedback
