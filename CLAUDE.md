# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a productivity timer web app project that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains only a basic README.md file and is ready for development to begin.

## Project Status
- **Current State**: Empty repository with git initialization
- **Purpose**: Productivity timer web application
- **Development Phase**: Initial setup/planning

## Development Setup
Since this is a new project with no existing build system or dependencies, the development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen during implementation.

## Architecture Notes
This project is starting from scratch, so architectural decisions will be made as development progresses. Future instances should check for:
- Package manager choice (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Framework selection (React, Vue, Vanilla JS, etc.)
- Build tools and configuration
- Testing framework setup
- Deployment configuration

## Next Steps for Development
When beginning work on this project, consider:
1. Choosing and setting up the development stack
2. Creating the initial project structure
3. Setting up build tools and development workflow
4. Implementing the core timer functionality
5. Adding productivity features as needed
